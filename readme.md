Datasets:  
The datasets used in the experiments were based on the three publicly available Twitter datasets released by Ma et al. (2016) and Ma et al. (2017):

Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Prasenjit Mitra, Sejeong Kwon, Bernard J Jansen, Kam-Fai Wong, and Meeyoung Cha. Detecting rumors from microblogs with recurrent neural networks. In Proceedings of IJCAI 2016.

In the 'data' folder we provide the pre-processed data files used for our experiments. The raw datasets can be respectively downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/46r50ctrfa0ur1o/rumdect.zip?dl=0. and https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ewzdrbelpmrnxu/rumdetect2017.zip?dl=0. For details about the datasets please contact Jing at: majing at se dot cuhk dot edu dot hk.

The Weibo datafile 'weibotree.txt' is in a tab-sepreted column format, where each row corresponds to a tweet. Consecutive columns correspond to the following pieces of information:

1: root-id -- an unique identifier describing the tree (weiboid of the root);

2: index-of-parent-weibo -- an index number of the parent weibo for the current weibo;

3: index-of-the-current-weibo -- an index number of the current weibo;

4: Fill with '1', no special meaning.

5: Fill with '1', no special meaning.

6: list-of-index-and-counts -- the rest of the line contains space separated index-count pairs, where a index-count pair is in format of "index:count", E.g., "index1:count1 index2:count2" (extracted from the "text" field in the json format from Weibo raw datasets)

The Twitter datafile 'data.TD_RvNN.vol_5000.txt' is in a tab-sepreted column format, where each row corresponds to a tweet. Consecutive columns correspond to the following pieces of information:

1: root-id -- an unique identifier describing the tree (tweetid of the root);

2: index-of-parent-tweet -- an index number of the parent tweet for the current tweet;

3: index-of-the-current-tweet -- an index number of the current tweet;

4: parent-number -- the total number of the parent node in the tree that the current tweet is belong to;

5: text-length -- the maximum length of all the texts from the tree that the current tweet is belong to;

6: list-of-index-and-counts -- the rest of the line contains space separated index-count pairs, where a index-count pair is in format of "index:count", E.g., "index1:count1 index2:count2" (extracted from the "text" field in the json format from Twitter)

Reproduce the experimental results:  
Run script "main.sh", choose "model/Weibo/BiGCN_Weibo.py" for BiGCN model on Weibo dataset or "model/Titter/BiGCN_Twitter.py" on Twitter15/Twitter16 dataset with
args: DatasetName, Iterations; e.g. run 'python ./model/Twitter/BiGCN_Twitter.py Twitter15 100' in "main.sh" to reproduce the experimental results of 100 iterations of BiGCN model on Twitter15 dataset.
